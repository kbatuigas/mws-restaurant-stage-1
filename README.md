# Project: Restaurant Reivews App
---

## Overview

The goal of this project is to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

The web application displays a list of restaurants across a range of cuisines within a given area. Each restaurant has a dedicated page which provides more information (opening hours, address) as well as a few reviews given by customers.

### Instructions for using the application

1. Download the application files from this repository.

2. Using the terminal, navigate to the directory where the repository has been saved.

3. Use Python to start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer:

- In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.

Alternatively, some code editors with Live Server capabilities (such as VS Code) may also be used to serve up the application files.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This application uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
